# Adventure Works on ASP.NET MVC 5 with EF 6 

Based on the initial MVC template at File \ New Project in Visual Studio 
using .NET Framework 4.7

After messing around with multiple projects e. g. one for DataAccess, Domain, 
Infrastructure, Services, etc. This time I'll be using regular folders for 
layering purpouses. If the need arises we can always add projects later.

One of the main reasons to do this is to experiment with Identity 2 which is 
included as default authorization/authentication mechanism when you pick 
Individual User Accounts in 'Choose your template' dialog in MVC 5.

This is a work in progress. 

The way I would write it.

I have no idea what I'm doing.
